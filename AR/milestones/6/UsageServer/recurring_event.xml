          <![CDATA[This adapter is responsible for changing states of accounts from closed to pending final bill and Closed to Archived.  The rules are:<BR>
Closed To Pending Final Bill: This operation gets triggered when there is usage that comes in as either late usage or as part of a straggler to an account that is in closed state.   End of period processing detects this and changes the account state to Pending Final Bill.<BR>
Closed To Archived: This transition happens when an account has aged x number of months (configurable) after being Closed.  End of period processing detects that changes the account state to Archived.
