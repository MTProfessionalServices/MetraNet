     You can search for an account using search criteria, such as 
    subscriber name, specific invoice number, address, phone number, or 
    company name. You can also use the MAM's &quot;Advanced Search&quot; 
    feature to narrow your search by selecting multiple search criteria.</P>
     <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Adding a New Account</SPAN> &#151; 
    You can add a new subscriber account to the MetraTech Account Manager

    is part of the MetraTech billing system.</P>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Viewing and Editing Contact and 
    Account Summary Information</SPAN> &#151; You can view a subscriber's 
    contact and account information to answer subscriber's basic account 
    questions, such as: &quot;When is my next bill due?&quot; You can

    and billing cycle.</P>
