Stuff done to port:

- added this directory Build/unix with makefile fragments

- errobj.h string->string.h 

- many templates missing allocator: map vector deque

- General SUN compiler problems: 
      no default template args allowed. use MT_TPL_* macros

      for function templates, must pass class param in the arg list.

      in enums, don't end list with a comma. (warning only)

      Don't do this (it crashes the SUNPRO CC compiler):
	list<Connection *>::iterator entrylist;
      Instead do this:
	typedef list<MT_TPL_ARGS(Connection *)> entrylist;
	entrylist::iterator it;


- implemented unixnet.  Simple HTTP connection stuff.

- st.csh is a little wrapper script for the starteam command
  interface. 

- in demo.cpp and mcidemo.cpp, need to typedef the list template
  to use the iterator. like this:

  typedef list<MT_TPL_ARGS(BroadcastEntry *)> entrylist;

- Made emulation functions for InitializeCriticalSection, etc. for
  unix.  These are base on solaris thread package.  May need to add or
  change for other unixes.

- when using ostream_withassign (and istream_withassign) you MUST
  initialize to NULL, else the destructor will crash.  (see solaris
  man page)

--------------
- NOTE: MetraTech HTTP server doesn't return content length!  Bad!

- unixnet implementation currently does not change any TCP socket
  defaults for timeouts.  Usually, it's not a good idea to mess with
  them.
 

How to build RW.
----------------

12 = multithread release static
15 = multi debug static

#to initialize a config:
/opt/rwspm/scripts/rwenv "rwbuild -m -z   -t12
-f/opt/rwspm/scripts/platform/sunpro.in
-i/opt/rwstd/workspaces/SOLARIS25/SUNPRO42/12s /opt/rwstd/parts/std0123u/source"

# to clean after hacking stdcomp.h
rwspm -c -a -p /opt/rwstd/workspaces/SOLARIS25/SUNPRO42/12s

# to rebuild only (no resetup)

/opt/rwspm/scripts/rwenv "rwbuild -m -z -t12 -i/opt/rwstd/workspaces/SOLARIS25/SUNPRO42/12s /opt/rwstd/parts/std0123u/source"

If you install rwstd to anyplace other than /opt/rwstd, you will have
to hack the makefiles to tell them where to get the lib and includes.

How to build MT SDK for unix.
-----------------------------

setenv BUILD_ROOT abssolute_path_to Development directory.
setenv BUILD_CONFIG sun4os5

make sure cc and CC from /opt/SUNWspro/bin are in your path.
make sure GNU make is in your path before sun make.

cd $BUILD_ROOT
make
