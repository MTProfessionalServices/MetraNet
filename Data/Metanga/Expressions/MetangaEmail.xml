Hello {Invoice.Payer.Name},

We noticed that we haven't recieved payment yet for invoice {Invoice.InvoiceNumber} that was due on {Invoice.InvoiceDueDate}.
This invoice has a balance of {Invoice.InvoiceCurrency.Symbol}{Invoice.Statement.EndingBalance}.
Could you please contact support to make a prompt payment?

Thank you,
Support
