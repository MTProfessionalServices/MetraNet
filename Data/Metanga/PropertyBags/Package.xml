  <Description>Packages are created to bundle together a group of products that are sold to customers. A package can include any number of products of many types. It is very common to create packages that include a recurring fee and a number of products that may be included as part of the recurring fee, or that are charged on a usage basis. Packages are associated to customers through subscriptions that have a start date, and possibly and end date.</Description>
