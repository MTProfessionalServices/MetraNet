Override Rates You can use the override table to specify the tax rate to be used for a particular tax. Overriding Exemptability By default, the US government deems certain taxes as exemptable and other taxes as not exemptable.   For example, if we specify that we want to exempt federal taxes, some taxes will be exempted and others won''t.  By using overrides you can choose the particular taxes that are exempt when an overall exemption is applied.  Note, that through overrides you can specify taxes that are exemptable, but you still must use the Exemption Table to specify which accounts are exempt. Specification of Accounts to OverrideOverrides can apply to all accounts, a heirarchy, or a particular account: global - applicable for all accounts in the system. In this case id_ancestor=-1 and id_acc = -1; hierarchical - applicable to all accounts under hierarchy. id_ancestor = xxx, and id_acc = -1; account specific - applicable only to one account. id_ancestor = -1, and id_acc = xxx.
