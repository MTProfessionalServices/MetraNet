1. New Features

-Local Mode has journal feature implemented.

Bug Fixes/Feature: 

2. Known Functional Constraints

-If a connection error occurs during playback, the exceptions that are printed might lead one to think that a parsing error occurred.
However, the exception is treated correctly by the SDK.     
-We don't yet support multithreading at the session level.

3. Fixed Bugs

-Pipeline error messages propagate all the way back to the cleint. This was not implemented in earlier versions of the SDK. The SDK will now throws the messages to the client, if pipeline fails in Synchronous metering.
-The exception that was thrown when the the input stream ended is now treated correctly.
