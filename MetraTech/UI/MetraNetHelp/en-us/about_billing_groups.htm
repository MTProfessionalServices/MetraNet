<h4 class="heading4">About Billing Groups</h4>
<p class="bodytext">The accounts that share the same interval are divided into billing groups. Billing groups are subsets of the total number of accounts that share an interval. Billing groups assist operators by allowing them to process groups independently of each another, meaning that they do not need to hold back bill generation for <em class="emphasis">all</em> accounts based on problems with <em class="emphasis">some</em> accounts. This allows for increased flexibility during bill processing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Configuration developers create the assignment query that assigns accounts to groups for each interval (which goes into effect when an operator clicks the <em class="emphasis">Create Billing Groups</em> button in the Billing Management page). The group can be based on any criteria, such as region, reseller, currency, usage volume, etc. If your configuration developer does not create an assignment query for your system, then you will only have one group for each interval. Operators can temporarily create more groups during processing by using pull lists. For more information, see <a id="h4874" class="" title="About Pull Lists" href="about_pull_lists.htm" target="_self">About Pull Lists</a>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Assignment queries consider only the paying accounts for the interval, meaning that (1) bill processing will always be based on paying accounts, (2) that the accounts contained in a billing group will always be payers, and (3) that the processing of paying accounts will also include processing for their paid-for accounts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Additionally, configuration developers are required to write their assignment queries to always process accounts with group subscriptions and shared counters as a unit. (If an operator attempts to create a pull list that separates accounts sharing the same counter, then an error is generated.) This restriction is required for specific adapters that use shared counters, such as the Discount and Aggregate Rating adapters.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An additional constraint on billing group processing are adapter types. For more information, see <a id="h4889" class="" title="Adapter Types" href="adapter_types.htm" target="_self">About Adapter Types</a>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At various stages during bill processing, either an operator or the system itself places billing groups in one of three <em class="emphasis">states</em>. When first created, a billing group's state is <script type="text/javascript"> popup4744 = "The state of a billing group between its creation and its soft close. While open, a billing group can accept all usage transactions assigned to its accounts. (When soft closed, bill processing is occurring and MetraNet will assign all transactions to the next appropriate interval.)\r"</script><a id="h4843" class="popup" title="Definition: Open State" href="javascript:hhctrl.TextPopup(popup4744, 'Arial,9',10,10,10,10)">open</a>. At the end of an interval's billing cycle, operators can begin <script type="text/javascript"> popup4765 = "Soft Closed\rA billing group's state is soft closed during its end-of-period processing. During soft close, the system performs functions such as end-of-period bill calculations and the creation of subscriber invoices. An interval cannot accept additional usage transactions during soft close, even if the transaction is for usage occurring during the interval's effective period. \xA0\xA0\xA0\r"</script><a id="h4844" class="popup" title="Definition: Soft Closed" href="javascript:hhctrl.TextPopup(popup4765, 'Arial,9',10,10,10,10)">soft closing</a> the interval's billing groups. When all adapters and checkpoints have been processed, then software places the billing group in a <script type="text/javascript"> popup4732 = "After the system has finished processing all adapters during soft close for a given billing group, and you have checked all of its processed data, you can place the billing group in a Hard Closed state. Hard Close \x22seals\x94 the billing group from receiving any new processing for the interval (including the reversal of completed adapter runs).\r"</script><a id="h4845" class="popup" title="Definition: Hard Closed" href="javascript:hhctrl.TextPopup(popup4732, 'Arial,9',10,10,10,10)">hard closed</a> state. When you have hard closed all of an adapter's billing groups, then the interval's processing is complete. (The interval's progress appears as &quot;100%&quot; in the Intervals and Manage Intervals pages.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">The purpose of billing groups is to help organize and automate the process of creating, tracking, and closing billing periods for each account. They enable bulk account processing, reducing the number of manual processes. At the same time, they increase manual control in cases where a minority of accounts encounters problems, allowing the rest of bill processing to move forward.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You cannot soft close an interval's billing groups until you have <em class="emphasis">hard closed</em> all previous intervals that use the same billing cycle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While bill processing is occurring, each interval in MetraNet will always contain at least one billing group.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A given billing group's membership will change from interval to interval&#8212;even if they use the same billing cycle&#8212;due to the fact that the billing group definition that configuration developers create <em class="emphasis">selects </em>accounts based on a criteria, and does not specify the accounts themselves. In other words, for any given interval a given account may meet a different billing group's criteria.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Billing groups do not appear until after they are created following the interval's end date.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are two types of billing groups:</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><strong class="strong">Recurring Billing Groups</strong> are groups of accounts that the MetraNet software defines for each interval based on criteria set by a configuration developer. The most common way for a configuration developer to assign accounts to billing groups is by region or reseller.<p class="listcontinue">An interval's recurring billing groups are created after the operator clicks the &quot;Create Billing Groups for Interval&quot; button in the Manage Interval page. These groups are generated based on a billing group definition created by a configuration developer. A given group's membership might change over time (<a id="h4849" class="" title="About Billing Groups" href="about_billing_groups.htm" target="_self">as explained above</a>).</p>
</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="strong">Pull Lists</strong> are groups that operators can create during bill processing. They do not last past a particular interval&#8217;s completion.<p class="listcontinue">An operator creates a pull list from the accounts residing in the other groups. A pull list enables you to set aside problem accounts for later resolution, allowing the rest of a group's accounts to process. A pull list is useful when an operator wants to separate out a group of accounts, thereby freeing up other groups that need to be processed, or freeing up the accounts in the pull list itself, when specific accounts need to process.</p>
