<h5 class="heading5">About Rate Schedule Effective Dates</h5>
<p class="bodytext">The application uses three factors to select a rate schedule:</p>
<ol class="listnumber"><li class="listnumber">Whether a given rate schedule is current, according to its effective dates .</li><li class="listnumber">Whether the rate schedule is subscription relative (that is, if it starts a specified number of days after subscription).</li><li class="listnumber">The length of time that the rate schedule is effective.</li></ol><p class="bodytext">The system first determines whether a rate schedule is current (whether the timestamp of the transaction falls in between the effective begin and end dates).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it determines if the rate schedule is subscription relative. If a current rate schedule is subscription relative, this kind of rate schedule always takes precedence over all other rate schedules.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Rate schedules that are effective for shorter periods are chosen over those with longer periods. If two rate schedules have different effective start dates and no end dates, the one with the later start date is considered the shorter one and is chosen. Similarly, if two rate schedules have no begin dates, but different end dates, then the one with the earlier end date is chosen.</p>
<p class="subheading">Example 1</p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Usage is metered on 9-15-01</em></p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Rate Schedule 1: Starts: NULL, Ends: NULL</em></p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Rate Schedule 2: Starts: 9-01,01, Ends: NULL</em></p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Rate Schedule 3: Starts: 10-01-01, Ends: 10-15-01</em></p>
<p class="bodytext">In this scenario, the system selects rate schedule 2 because a) it is current as of the timestamp of the transaction and b) it has the smallest date range of any of the applicable rate schedules. Rate schedule 1's effective period is &quot;longer&quot; than rate schedule 2, so it is not selected. Rate schedule 3 is shorter than all three, but is not current as of 9-15-01.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When two current rate schedules have different begin and end dates, but have the same effective period, then the one with the most recent start date takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The MetraOffer user interface does not allow the entry of rate schedules with identical begin and end dates. However, in rare cases, a rate schedule with a &quot;Next Billing Period&quot; begin or end date might have the exact same start, end, and effective period as another rate schedule. In these cases, the system chooses the topmost rate schedule listed in the MetraOffer user interface.</p>
<p class="subheading">Example 2</p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Usage is metered on 9-01-01</em></p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Rate Schedule 1: Starts: 9-01-01, Ends: 9-10-01</em></p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Rate Schedule 2: Starts: Next billing cycle after 8-15-01, Ends: 9-10-01</em></p>
<p class="bodytext">Rate schedules 1 and 2 have identical effective periods if the user is on a monthly billing cycle that starts on the first of the month. The system will choose the first rate schedule.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For recurring charges, note that Advance and Arrears cycle properties contribute to determining what timestamps are used in the selection of a current rate schedule. In the case of a recurring charge with an Arrears property, the system uses the date of the conclusion of each cycle as the timestamp for determining the rate schedule. For an Advance recurring charge, the system uses the last day of the account's billing cycle as the timestamp.</p>
<p class="subheading">Example of the selection of a recurring charge rate schedule</p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">A subscriber is billed on the 15th of the month. A recurring charge's cycle is weekly. The rate schedules that fall within the month are the following:</em></p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Rate Schedule 1: Starts: 9-01,01, Ends: 09-30-01</em></p>
<p class="listcontinue"><em class="emphasis">Rate Schedule 2: Starts: 10-01-01, Ends: NULL</em></p>
<p class="bodytext">The system determines what rate schedule to use for a recurring charge cycle ending on 10-01-01. If the cycle has Arrears as its property, then the customer is billed for the cycle on 10-15-01, and rate schedule 2 is used. If the property for the cycle is Advance, then the customeris billed on 09-15-01, and rate schedule 1 is used.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Discounts and aggregate usage charges always use the conclusion of each cycle as a timestamp to determine the appropriate rate schedule.</p>
