We had been following the passphrase recommendation of mtkey for all passphrases during installation.  Turns out that core uses different phrases.  The one for the user passwords is PasswordHash.

<p>
This impacted the reference data loader as it generated the encrypted passwords using mtkey.  I've refactored the code to use a preference for the passphrase.  It loads/saves too.

Tests have a group property.  The UI automatically builds a tab for each unique group it finds.  I would suggest that the BME tests get a group named “BME” and the audit tests go to group Audit.

Something is now wrong with the way I'm adding the Manage Account Hierarchies capability to the accounts.  That is currently commented out.  You have to add that by hand in MetraCare if you want to view the on-line bill.
