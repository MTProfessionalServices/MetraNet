<h1>Stress Test</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Stress Test simulates a large volume of varied tests that may happen concurrently.  Each test type has average calls per hour.  We use a random Poisson distribution function to determine the start of the next individual test.  This means that tests aren't called precisely every N time-units.
</p>
<p>
The Stress Tester is currently coded to use 4 background worker threads to run individual tests.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
The Stress Test is configured under the preferences menu.  Each test can be enabled or disabled.  The text box per test is the number of calls per hour on average.
