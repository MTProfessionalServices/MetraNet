    <description>This stage will apply a pcode to each account which is identified by the usage. If the account already has a pcode, then it is updated. Nothing more exotic occurs here, however this would be very bad for system performance. Thus it is recommended to apply more selective update methods say only once every 24 hours per account, or maybe every 30 days...anyway, this is just a test of the plugin for billsoft pcode generation.</description>
