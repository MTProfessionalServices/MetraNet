<p class="bodytext">The diagram above represents an interval for a weekly billing cycle. There are also bi-weekly, twice monthly, monthly, quarterly, and annual billing cycles.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As soon as Usage Server Maintenance creates an interval, it can accept usage records. After an interval's end date, the operator can click the Create Billing Groups button and begin placing its billing groups in a soft closed state to initiate the interval's account processing. While in a soft closed state, a billing group's accounts cannot accept new usage into the interval being closed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Note that billing groups can remain in an open state indefinitely. A billing group can still accept usage during its open period as long as the usage transaction is time-stamped during the interval's effective period . Also note that an interval's billing groups can remain in <script type="text/javascript"> popup4765 = "Soft Closed\rA billing group's state is soft closed during its end-of-period processing.
