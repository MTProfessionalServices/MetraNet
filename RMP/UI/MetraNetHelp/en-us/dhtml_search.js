The arrangement of accounts into departments, cost centers, office locations, or other useful categories of accounts can be as simple or as sophisticated as required.","The following example uses TravelSpot, a hypothetical service provider, and Cutting Edge, a hypothetical service client company. ","TravelSpot implements Cutting Edge's org chart using the MetraCare out-of-the-box account types: Corporate, Department, and Core Subscriber. ","To start the process of building this account hierarchy, a TravelSpot account administrator creates a Corporate account to represent the service client company.","A service provider creates a corporate account for each of its client companies.","The administrator then adds the San Francisco, Munich, and Kyoto office locations using the Department account type. She also adds Cutting Edge's CEO as a Core Subscriber.","To track costs for each department in each location, the adminstrator adds the cost-center departments for each region, again using the department account type. ","Departments are the containers in the account hierarchy. They can represent departments, cost centers, subsidiaries, office locations, types of employees, or any other grouping of accounts that are useful to an organization.","For the Munich office, the administrator adds the office manager and three departments. There is no limit to how many levels of departments that can be nested in the hierarchy.","The department account type, or an equivalent account type, not only helps CSRs locate an account in Cutting Edge's hierarchy, but also plays an important role in accounting and budgeting by enabling costs to be tracked by department.","CSR are usually responsible for adding the regular subscriber accounts for each department, such as those in the Munich finance department.","For TravelSpot, each CoreSubscriber account is a Cutting Edge employee who uses TravelSpot services. If Cutting Edge had another kind of subscriber that was not part of the corporate organization, the TravelSpot administrator could use another kind of account type to represent them.","In this hierarchy, departments can be nested within other departments because the Department account type is configured to have CoreSubscriber accounts as descendants. However, the CoreSubscriber account is not configured to have parents of the CoreSubscriber type. However, this behavior is fully configurable.","An administrator or CSR does not have to create accounts manually. The MetraNet software can also be used to import account hierarchy information from external systems.","Building an Account Hierarchy","14442.htm");

One group of columns contains conditions, the other contains actions.","In determining the subscriber's rates for a given instance of usage, the system starts at the top line of the rate schedule and determines if that line's conditions are met.","If the conditions are met, then the system applies that line's actions&#8212;which usually involve applying the correct rate to the account. If the conditions are not met, then the system proceeds to the next line and checks if those conditions are met.

But there is a second problem: after the Invoice adapter runs, the operator discovers some incorrect rates for a particular aggregate rated service. The operator can place the accounts with the erroneously-rated service in another pull list. The operator can then reverse this pull list out, all the way back to the aggregate adapter, and then rerun bill processing for the pull list. (See #3 in the diagram. Again, the reversals are not depicted.)

But similarly to the above, all billing groups will have to stop at the Invoice adapter and wait until the second pull list catches up to the other billing groups' processing.

This checkpoint gives the operator a final opportunity to verify that all data is correct before emails are sent out. After the operator confirms this checkpoint, processing can continue.

","For example, a customer signs up for P1 on January 1 with an annual subscription. The customer now wants to sign up for P2 on June 15, but wants to be billed annually at the same time as P1. Using the instant prorate functionality, the CSR would sign up the customer for two subscriptions to P2, one from June 15, 2011 &#8211; December 31, 2011, and one beginning January 1, 2012 and continuing indefinitely.

","When you prorate on subscription, you give a discount based on the start date of the subscription and how far it is into the period. For example, a priceable item costs $365 per year, and a customer signs up 15 days into the period, so the charge is $350. ","When you prorate on unsubscription, you give a credit for any unused time when a customer unsubscribes. For example, a priceable item costs $365 per year, and a customer unsubscribes with one month left. The customer should get a credit for $30. However, the customer won&#8217;t receive the credit until the last month of the subscription. So a customer that signs up in the middle of the year will be charged the full amount and not receive a refund until the end of the year..","Using instant proration ","A CSR can specify a priceable item&#8217;s proration to be instant, which means that customers will be prorated from subscription date to unsubscription date instantaneously, rather than waiting until the actual unsubscription date. When a priceable item is marked as instant prorate, the system checks for the unsubscription date at the first charge period. If the customer has an unsubscribe date, the system will compute the customer's payment for that period.","Using the example from above, where a customer is aligned on January 1 and signs up for P2 on June 15, the CSR would sign the customer up from 6/15 through 12/31, and the customer would only be billed for half the year on P1.","Limitations","The Prorate Instantly option is applicable to Prorate on Unsubscription.
