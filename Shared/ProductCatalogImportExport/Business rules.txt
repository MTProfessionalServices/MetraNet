Implementation Review:

	
	- ORACLE has not been tested
		- queries need to be checked.

	- Product Catalog API change
		RateSchedule.Exist()
		Subscription.CanSubscribe

	- Upgrade
		 Just curious, but how are we planning to support upgrading a customer's product catalog from 3.0 to 3.5 (or 4.0 for that matter).  As long as the platform extensions are loaded and synchronized, we should be able to export the prod cat from the 3.0 machine and import it into the 3.5 machine, right?

	- Last minute new feature
		-multifile po
		-exported xml validity

	- Performance

	- Parameter Table Check Sum

	- Subscrition already exist is an error

	- Usage of PCImportExport 3.5 before 3.5 is shipped.

	- With Group subscription there is a notion of date to look up corporate account and group subscription
		Should I pass the date as a parameter.
	- Api to get the corporation list does not return the corporation name space
		Set Rowset = objMTYAAC.GetAncestorMgr.HierarchyRoot(Now).GetChildListAsRowset

	- Group Subscription Business Rule
		We must verify that all the account/member of a group subscription exist before we create the group subscription
		if one account is missing we will raise a warning say Group subscription was not created because an account is missing...

	- Subscription Business Rule
		If an account cannot be found we raise a warning and go to the next account/subscription

	Limitation
		We do not support 2 Corporations with the same name in 2 different name space.
		We cannot export a group subscription from a corporation created in the future.



TODO
	Add - Bacl List of PO, PL, PI Template 
	
	Unit Test - Import a valid PO and Roll Back - DONE

	Unit Test - 1 error in import price list
	Unit Test - Unit Test subcription does re-export the subscription and compare

	-	DONE UnitTest Compare should check the rateschedule xml
	-	DONE Export Counter does not work in 3.5

3.5 Remarks

	- Calendar read write performance must be improved.
	- Export/Import rule must be written like :
		When a calendar had no calenderday the tag <calendardays> is not generated.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


QUESTION - What do if in the middle of the import - we realise a price able item type is missing....
	   Check first
	


TO DO

	ask fabricio how to link a calendar to a product offering.

	PriceAbleTime Cycle do not use cyclytypeid but set all the property
	Verify the properties to ignore but ok!


LIMITATION For the QA Tools
	- We do not export subscription
	- ICB PriceList
	


BUSINESS RULE

	- PriceList must have a name  
 	- Is PriceList Name unique across the system
	- We do not export/import ICB Price List , which by the way may not have a name
	- RateSchedule Unique Name		
		' PriceAbleItem Name + ParamTable Name + PriceListName + RateSchedule.EffectiveDate.StartDate + RateSchedule.EffectiveDate.StartDateType +  RateSchedule.EffectiveDate.StartOffset
	- Why EnumConfig slowdown com+
	- One RateSchedule  has only 1  price List ??? RateSchedule.GetPriceList()

	- Export each rate in one file named after the ParamTable Name
	- Rate export Enun Type 
		Do we export FQN
	
	- CycleID, CycleTypeID
		<imtaggregatecharge name="Song Downloads">
			<imtpccycle name="Cycle">
				  <imtproperty name="AdapterProgID">MTStdUsageCycle.MTStdWeekly.1</imtproperty> 
				  <imtproperty name="CycleID">31</imtproperty> 
				  <imtproperty name="CycleTypeDescription">Weekly</imtproperty> 
				  <imtproperty name="CycleTypeID">4</imtproperty> 


	- What Happens is a counter is not set
	- What if a PriveAble Item in a PO does not have a price list



NEW SPEC
	- We will export this ID, they will be ignored by the import. This could be use full to QA and other
	To export a product catalog and verify relation.
	This property cannot be changed...
	

TASK LIST
	- Set the return code  TRUE
	- Check the return code
	- static_objEnumConfig.GetEnumeratorByID(CLng(value)) How do you get the fqn

Let us review my design to implement this first phase of the Product Catalog Import/Export.

I would like to remember you that my goal is not to do the 3.5 feature Product Catalog Import/Export but only to :

	- write source code that can be used by QA in about 1 week to import Product catalog to test 3.0
	- Re use fully the source code when we will code the 3.5 feature.

I will email you the functional design doc made during 2.0. 

Agenda based on the functional design doc

	- Export/Import Business rule
		- We do not export ICB Price List

	- Overall architecture of the COM Objects
		- Visual Basic
		- XML Parsing with MS Sax Engine
		- Logging
		- Error management
			- Object already exist
			- un expected run time error
		- Performance measurement
			- Time per main functions : ExportPriceAbleItem
			- exported and imported object count

	- File
		XML Format
		Folder convention
		File Name convention

	- Basic command line for this phase.
