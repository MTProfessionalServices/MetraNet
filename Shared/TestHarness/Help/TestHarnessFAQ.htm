<BR>

<BR><BR><H2>What is the difference between .WSF and .VBS file?</H2>
<hr size=1>
VBS are VBScript file and WSF are Window Script Hosting file. WSF is based on VBScript but
add features (<a Target="_TOP" HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm">http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm</a>).
With VBS file you can debug your test file and you do not need the IIS Virtual Link on the test database.
Look in the Test Database Template.Library there are different samples.<BR>

<BR><BR><H2>Why do I need a IIS Virtual Link to the Test Database</H2>
<hr size=1>
In WSF file we use an URL to include the class CTest.vbs. If the virtual link is not created or IIS is not running the test will fail.<BR>

<BR><BR><H2>Why do I need an Environment Variable MetraTechTestDatabase</H2>
<hr size=1>
 The Test Harness and the class CTest.vbs uses the MetraTechTestDatabase Environment Variable to retreive where is the test
 database located.<BR>

<BR><BR><H2>How should I handle error in my test program?</H2>
<hr size=1>
 If an error is raise by VBScript or any COM object called, the test will end and the instance Test As New CTest 
 will tell the Test Harness that the test failed. Therefore, it is not mandatory to catch errors.<BR>

<BR><BR><H2>How do I start a new Test?</H2>
<hr size=1>
 Copy the file VBScript.Template and paste it somewhere in the Test Database.<BR>

<BR><BR><H2>What are the global parameters?</H2>
<hr size=1>
 The Test Harness implements a notion of global parameters. These parameters are always passed to the command line.
 The parameters are defined in the test called GLOBAL that is located in the root of the Test Database.
 It is possible to exclude the global parameters from the command line for each test. See the Edit Test Dialog.
 It is also possible to specify the Command Line Format for each test. See the Edit Test Dialog.<BR>
 
<BR><BR><H2>What are the Test Session parameters?</H2>
<hr size=1>
Test Session Parameters are command line parameters that are created by a test during the execution of
a test session and are available to the following tests in the session.

<BR><BR><H2>Can I include my own VBScript Library in my test file?</H2>
<hr size=1>
 Yes, see the syntax used to include CTest.vbs. The syntax supports an http call or a file call.<BR>
  WSF syntax :<BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript" SRC="http://localhost/MetraTechTestDatabase/MyLibrary/MyLibrary.vbs" /&gt;<BR>
  &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript" SRC="../../MyLibrary/MyLibrary.vbs" /&gt;
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  VBS syntax : you must call the include function from the Main() function<BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Include Environ("MetratechTestDatabase") & "\Development\ui\uiLib\MyLib.vbs"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    
<BR><BR><H2>Can I create my own VBScript class in my test?</H2>
<hr size=1>
 Yes. As a serious OO developer you should. Get the VBScript help.<BR>

 TestSessionParameters.Item("Server").Value = "SAUGE"<BR>
 Server = TestSession.Item("Server").Value<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BR><BR><H2>Can I run my test without the Test Harness?</H2>
<hr size=1>
Yes each test can run with or without the Test Harness. It is even possible to detect id the Test Harness is running.<BR>
