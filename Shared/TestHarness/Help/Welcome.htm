<H1>MetraTech Test Harness 3.5.5 Help</H1>
<H2>What's New</H2>

<H3>New Find Function</H3><hr size=1>
You can find a test or a test session from the current selected node, by pression CTRL+F,
or do a mouse right click. The Find function support the wildcard like the DIR command.

<H3>Multi Database support</H3><hr size=1>
It is now possible to use more than one database. The environment variable METRATECHDATABASE still point to the main
database. But the install allows you to add other environment variable METRATECHDATABASE1, METRATECHDATABASE2,...
These external Test Databases will appear at the root level of the main database with a green folder icon.<br>
<br>
The first usage is to support ATT Development, Services and QA tests which must not be stored in the main database but
in the services\extension folder.

<H3>Test Execution Sub Module</H3><hr size=1>
A Test has now a new property called : PopUpDefinition. This property is supposed to contains
a list of Name. If this property is defined, then when you right click on a Test the option
"Execution PopUp" will be visible. If you chose it, it will display the list of names.
If you click on one the test will be executed, with the extra command line paramater :<BR>
-Execute NAME<br>
<br>
It is sometime handy to allow to test just a sub module in a bug test.
See the test "MOM Full Application Test" for more details.
<br>

The database loading is much faster, but since our database is also increasing you must not see that.<br>
The loading of the static file (xml,txt,dat,csv) is now optional and turned off by default.<br>
See options dialog.

content:<BR>
<BR>        
[BAG]    <BR>
SQLServer=BigDisk<BR>
SQLDatabase=TestHarnessCoverageDB<BR>
SQLUserName=sa<BR>
SQLPassWord=<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The sql table is t_TestDashBoard.

<H3>You can insert into a test parameter value any environment variable value.</H3><hr size=1>
This is very use full when you need to pass
to a program the full path of a file stored in the test database. Because at edit time you do not
know the full path by setting the parameter value this way you can solve the problem:<br>
<br>
Test Parameter Name : file<br>
Test Parameter value  : %METRATECHTESTDATABASE%\Development\UI\Application Tests\FredRunner.Library\MAM.Test.vbs<br>
<br>
<i>The name must be in upper case.</i>

Better error handling if Windows Script Hosting is not installed or not correctly installed.

<H3>Optimization</H3><hr size=1>

when you edit a test.<BR>
 - The Test Harness tests is the METRATECHDATABASE Internet Information Server virtual link is working.

<H3>Install</H3><hr size=1>
The setup will ask your local path to the Tests Database and will create the 
Internet Information Server virtual link and the environment variable.
You can also run this feature this way : TestHarness.exe /I.

<H3>MTTestApi COM Object New Environ Property</H3><hr size=1>
You can read and write environment variable from the CTest class this way.<BR>

</FONT>
<BR>  
The Environment variables group used by default is USER. You can also specify it this way:<BR>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New" Size=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test.UTApi.Environ("FRED_PATH","SYSTEM") = "c:\program files\fred_path"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strS                      = Test.UTApi.Environ("FRED_PATH","SYSTEM")<BR>
</FONT>
<BR>  
 

<H3>Bugs fixed</H3><hr size=1>
- It is now possible to execute one test or more Test from the command line.<br>
- It is now possible to execute a tests and  tests session from the same command line.<br>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New" Size=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TestHarness.exe -test c:\Tests database\MyTest.Test -testsession c:\Tests database\MySession.TestSession<BR>

<br>

- Tree view state bug Each time you open or close a folder the test harness store the info. In the previous version the state

WSF files are still supported.<BR>
If you start a new test use the template:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Templates.Library\TestTemplate.vbs<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
To activate the debug mode, open the open dialog, tab script engine.<BR>

<H3>Test Session Parameters</H3><hr size=1>
It is now possible for a test to pass command line parameters to the next test during a test session execution.<BR>
This feature was asked by Ralf and should be very usefull for writing system tests.<BR>
