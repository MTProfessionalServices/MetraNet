   W3Runner automates testing to ensure that Web Applications running 
   under Microsoft&reg; Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 work as 
   expected. You record and edit the user interactions with the VBScript 
   Language and afterwards you can run your test. To program the HTML 
   user interface objects W3Runner supplies a simplified, Visual Basic 
   Like programming interface through 2 COM Objects. Have a look at the 
   programming sample . </P>

   default VBScript source code that goes with the object. </P>
  <P>
   Because you use VBScript : <BR>
   You can write any kind of check point, data-driven test or regression 
   tests. W3Runner supplies by default the class CDB which allow to
