       	This adapter is also responsible for changing states of accounts from 
       	pending final bill to closed. The rules are:
        <BR>Pending Final Bill To Closed: 
        This operation is interval based, i.e. it behaves like an EOP
        adapter. The transition happens when the hard closed has reached on
        that specific interval.
