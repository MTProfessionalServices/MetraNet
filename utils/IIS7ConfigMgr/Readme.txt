Added Files:

	IIS7ConfigMgr.exe
	IIS7ConfigMgr.pdb

Description:

This utility is called by the installer. Properly configures virtual directories on 64-bit Windows Server 2008 systems. These should be removed from the installer and from source control when a more suitable peranent solution is developed to address this issue.

Note: These files are installed to the RMP\Bin folder along with all of the other MetraNet binaries.
