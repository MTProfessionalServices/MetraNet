The MetraCryptoMigrate utility is controlled through the .properties files,
which contain a set of actions the user wants to perform.

There can be one or more actions in a single .properties file.
If you don't want to use some of the actions in a given file
you can either remove the action definition from the file
or you can set the "active" property to false.

===========================================================================================
Data Export Action:
-------------------

tid - Transaction ID for a data migration operation, which includes a data export
      and a data import actions. The "tid" value in the data export action 
      settings must match the 'tid' value during the corresponding data import action.

'dttPassPhrase' - Passphrase that's used to protect secret data migration operation
                  information. It must be at least 12 characters long (can contain spaces).

'serverLocation' - IP/name for the computer where the database with credit card number
                   info is located.

'dbName' - database name for the database where the credit card number info is located.
           For distributed installations it's NetmeterPay and for standalone installations
           it's Netmeter.

'uid' - SQL database account ID to access the database identfied by 'dbName'.

'password' - SQL database account password to access the database identified by 'dbName'. 

'rsaKmcConfigFileName' - Must point to the RSA Key Manager Client key.cfg file. When you set 
                         this property make sure to use double backslashes if you use 
                         windows path separators.

'rsaKmcCertPass' - Must contain the password for the RSA Key Manager Client certificate file.
                   The value for this property should populated based on the KMS certificate
                   password field in the MetraTech mtsecurity.xml file.

'mirror' - Set to 'true' to save the old and new values for the transformed data in a data
           mirror store file (which is an SQLite database that can be viewed
           with the SQLite Database Browser tool distributed in the package).

'updateSource' - Set to 'true' to save the transformed data back to the MetraTech product database.

This action produces several files that need to be available for the corresponding
data import action.

All data export actions generate at least two files:

<TID>.dtt and State.<TID>.export.Das.Store

If you enable data mirroring than a third file will be generated:

<TID>.export.Dmm.Store

This DMM file is an SQLite database file that contains a map for the old and new card number
along with the original index information. This file can be useful for debugging purposes.

When data export is done the total number of records and the number of tranformed records
is displayed (and written to the log file). For successful data export actions these
two numbers must match.

===========================================================================================
Data Import Action:
-------------------

tid - Transaction ID for a data migration operation, which includes a data export
      and a data import actions. The "tid" value in the data import action 
      settings must match the 'tid' value during the corresponding data export action.

'dttPassPhrase' - Passphrase that's used to protect secret data migration operation
                  information. It must be at least 12 characters long (can contain spaces).
                  It must be the same value used for the corresponding data export action.

'NetmeterPay.serverLocation' - IP/name for the computer where the database with credit card number
                               info is located.

'NetmeterPay.dbName' - database name for the database where the credit card number info is located.
                       For distributed installations it's NetmeterPay and for standalone installations
                       it's Netmeter.

'NetmeterPay.uid' - SQL database account ID to access the database identfied by 'NetmeterPay.dbName'.

'NetmeterPay.password' - SQL database account password to access the database identified by 'NetmeterPay.dbName'. 

'Netmeter.serverLocation' - IP/name for the computer where the database with credit card number hash
                            info is located.

'Netmeter.dbName' - database name for the database where the credit card number hash info is located.
                    It's always Netmeter.

'Netmeter.uid' - SQL database account ID to access the database identfied by 'NetmeterPay.dbName'.

'Netmeter.password' - SQL database account password to access the database identified by 'NetmeterPay.dbName'. 


'rsaKmcConfigFileName' - Must point to the RSA Key Manager Client key.cfg file. When you set 
                         this property make sure to use double backslashes if you use 
                         windows path separators.

'rsaKmcCertPass' - Must contain the password for the RSA Key Manager Client certificate file.
                   The value for this property should populated based on the KMS certificate
                   password field in the MetraTech mtsecurity.xml file.

'mirror' - Set to 'true' to save the old and new values for the transformed data in a data
           mirror store file (which is an SQLite database that can be viewed
           with the SQLite Database Browser tool distributed in the package).

'updateSource' - Set to 'true' to save the transformed data back to the MetraTech product database.

'fromMirror' - Set to 'true' to import data from an export data mirror. This param must be enabled
               when 'updateSource' in the corresponding data export action was set to 'false'.
               This param can be set to 'true' even if 'updateSource' from the corresponding
               data export action was set to 'true' as long as the 'mirror' in that data export
               action was set to 'true' as well. This is a way to minimize the number of data
               modifications in the MetraTech product database where you can export data into
               a data mirror file and then import that data back from the data mirror file.

When data import is done the total number of records and the number of tranformed records
is displayed (and written to the log file). For successful data import actions these
two numbers must match.

===========================================================================================
Generate Data Signature Action:
-------------------------------

This action produces the number of records and a hash for all credit card number records.

This information is printed to the screen and written to the log file. It can also be
found in the "State.<TID>.generator.Das.Store" file (this is an SQLite file that can be examined
with any SQLite database viewer application including the one available with the package).

===========================================================================================
Verify Data Signature Action:
-----------------------------

This action produces the number of records and a hash for all credit card number records
comparing the results with the values from the corresponding data signature generation action.
If the values match it prints out a message indicating a successful data signature verification.
