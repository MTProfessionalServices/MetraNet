The MetraCryptoMigrate utility is controlled through the .properties files,
which contain a set of actions the user wants to perform.

There can be one or more actions in a single .properties file.
If you don't want to use some of the actions in a given file
you can either remove the action definition from the file
or you can set the "active" property to false.


========================================================================================

Data Export Action:

The "tid" value in the data export action settings must match the 'tid' value
during the corresponding data import action.

'dttPassPhrase' - must be at least 12 characters long 

'rsaKmcConfigFileName' - must point to the RSA Key Manager Client key.cfg file
'rsaKmcCertPass' - must contain the password for the RSA Key Manager Client certificate file

This action produces several files that need to be available for the corresponding
data import action.

All data export actions generate at least two files:

<TID>.dtt and State.<TID>.export.Das.Store

If you enable data mirroring than a third file will be generated:

<TID>.export.Dmm.Store

This DMM file is an SQLite database file that contains a map for the old and new card number
along with the original index information. This file can be useful for debugging purposes.

============================================================================================

NOTES:

When you set the 'rsaKmcConfigFileName' property make sure to use double backslashes
if you use windows path separators.

The value for the 'rsaKmcCertPass' property should populated based on the KMS certificate
password field in the MetraTech mtsecurity.xml file.
