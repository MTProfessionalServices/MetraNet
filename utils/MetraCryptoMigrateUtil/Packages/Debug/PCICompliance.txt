To be PCI compliant sensitive data (such as credit card number and password information)
MUST NOT be stored or transferred in clear text. 

This means that you should populate 'dttPassPhrase', 'password', and 'rsaKmcCertPass'
properties only when you are using the tool. Do not send .properties files
with those fields populated with real values.
